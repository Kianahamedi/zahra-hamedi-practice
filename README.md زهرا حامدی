Considering the importance and application of artificial intelligence and image processing in medical fields, we decided to investigate the methods of converting two-dimensional medical images to three-dimensional and propose a new method in this case. In this article, in the beginning, the history of MRI devices will be presented comprehensively, after that, the constituent parts and the way the device works, and finally, the methods of producing 2D and 3D images will be explained. In the proposed method, two-dimensional photos are prepared around the three axes of coordinates with the maximum amount needed and will be discussed in a specialized manner in the following, they will be placed next to each other and will form a three-dimensional image, in which the possibility of zooming and rotating the image will exist .In this new method, the empty spaces between the two slices are filled and the accuracy of the images is increased and the time of tumor detection in many parts of the body is reduced. In all stages of image conversion, it will be scientifically testable in the MATLAB coding environment, after receiving the appropriate output, the final program can be designed and used in the Python and OpenCV environments.
